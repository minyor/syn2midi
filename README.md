# syn2midi
Create pianobooster midi from youtube piano video lessons (Synthesia).

I can't read sheet music very well and prefer to use pianobooster to learn.
It was always upset me, the lack of midi files to learn new music in the internet.
There's plenty of Synthesia piano video lessons on youtube though..
So here you have it. A youtube video lesson to MIDI converter.

## Installation:
- For Windows, download and unpack lattest binary archive from here:
https://github.com/minyor/syn2midi/releases
- For other OS'ses you have to compile it using CodeLite IDE or similar tools

## Usage:
- Download video lesson using one of online youtube downloaders like this one:
http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/
So, this video, for example (make sure to select mp4 conversion format):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHdbjCLDg2A
- Choose which mask image best suits your video (82 or 88 notes). Or generate your own (see instructions below)
- Generate MIDI file using:
	syn2midi -m mask.bmp -i Every27Years.mp4 -o Every27Years.midi

## Custom key colors:
Optionally you can specify up to 8 key colors to use in notes parsing, 4 colors for left hand and 4 for right hand.
For example, here are the default colors (make sure there's no spaces in color paremeters):

syn2midi -m mask.bmp -i Every27Years.mp4 -o Every27Years.midi -l (40,96,167)(112,167,211)(252,182,92)(246,126,16) -r (237,120,122)(232,79,78)(140,242,44)(92,170,11)

## Other options:
Optional: [-t transpose notes shift, can be negative -t-1. 0 is default]

Optional: [-s start time in seconds] [-e end time in seconds]

Optional: [-R boolean, include to generate report] (thanks to https://github.com/DanLatimer)

## Custom Mask creation:
Not all synthesia videos you find will work with included mask images. You might need to create your own mask.
These are the recommended steps to create matching mask image for your video:
- Play a video, pause it when no piano key is pressed!
- Now make a fullscreen screenshot (best if you can use video player's screenshot functionality if it has one)
- Make sure that aspect ratio of a screenshot image matches aspect ratio of a video (This is important, otherway result may be wrong)
- Open screenshot in 2D image editor, for example GIMP, set pen color as RGB(0,0,255) i.e Blue.
- Place blue dot of a diameter about 25 - 75% of key width at each white and black key (try to avoid places with markings and other artifacts)
- Export your screenshot as BMP 24bit file format (Click at 'Do not write color space information')

Thats it, your mask should be ready

 Keep in mind that you can reuse your generated masks.
 If visually key layout in the video is the same, then there are good chances that mask will work.
